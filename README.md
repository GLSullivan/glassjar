# Glass Jar: The Future of Financial Planning by Greg Sullivan

Hello there! I'm Greg Sullivan, the brains behind the development of Glass Jar. If you've stumbled upon this page, you might be a prospective client or employer, seeking a glimpse into my programming prowess. **Guess what? You're in for a treat!** Bear in mind, though, that Glass Jar is an ongoing project, only recently made public. So, bring your spirit of understanding and exploratory mindset along as you delve into the depths of this repository.

## What is Glass Jar?

Glass Jar is a financial calendar envisioned to help you plan your financial future, years in advance. Each of your accounts represents a separate calendar, while each transaction resembles an event. 

Features of Glass Jar include efficient tools to quickly input your financial information, extraordinarily versatile tools to repeat events, catering to the specific needs of financial transactions (think accurately scheduling twice monthly events as in Google Calendar) and a user interface that's evolving towards visual delight!

### Limitations and Opportunities

Glass Jar is a living, breathing project under **vigorous development**. Currently, it has a mobile-friendly design focus. (I haven't written line 1 for the desktop experience.) While some features have been meticulously outlined, others are just starting to take shape. Despite being a work-in-progress, it's already **a potent and efficient application**. So, stay tuned for regular updates.

As a solo developer, there might have been occasions where my commit messages or code comments could've been more explicit. Bear with me! I aim to improve these aspects shortly.

### The Tech Stack

Glass Jar is written in React and TypeScript. State management is handled using Redux Toolkit. The CSS employs the BEM model with a unique prefix (glassjar__). Google Firebase provides the backbone for database and user management. Formik and Yup play a role in form construction, except for the more complex and interactive ones, which rely on proprietary validation code. You'll also notice extensive use of date-fns and other standard libraries. Bonus fun fact: All art was made with MidJourney!
